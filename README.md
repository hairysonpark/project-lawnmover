Abstract
In this project you will set up an environment for implementing algorithms in C++, and use that to implement two algorithms that solve the same problem. The first step is for you to become familiar with GitHub and makefiles. We will use GitHub to submit and grade projects all semester. The second step is for you to translate descriptions of two algorithms into pseudocode; analyze your pseudocode mathematically; implement each algorithm in C++; test your implementation; and describe your results. The third step is to do research on the Internet about the usefulness of having a .gitignore file and create the file .gitignore in your directory.
